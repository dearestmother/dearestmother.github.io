Location: Ketchican, AK

We back tracked past the Tracy Arm Fyord to return to Ketchican to restock on chicken tendies.

The plan is to barter with the natived and are willing to trade off Morgan as part of the deal.

The weather gets colder as we travel south. Perhaps if we continued to the north, we would have found a tropical paradise.

Thate would explain the desert we found in the Northern Territories of Canada.
