This weedkend, we had the great race. Thirty competitors lined their tractors up on the edge of a field and decided to run 500 oval laps around the boundary.

When the flag waved, they all rocketed off at a blistering speeds of up to 20 miles per hour. Twelve laps in, one of the racers hit a gopher hole and spun out into the hay. Lap 14 saw a group of three more racers lose traction on some pebbles and cause a tremendous pile up. By lap 21, nearly half of the tractors were out of commission from collisions or other mechanical failures.

The race ended uncerimoniosly at lap 37 when the last driver had a wheel fall off and he just kind of tipped over and skidded for 10 feet. We rushed out and celebrated his win with a fresh cup of milk serviced in a special cup for him to drink.

It was decided that next year, the goal would be just 50 laps instead of the lofty 500.
