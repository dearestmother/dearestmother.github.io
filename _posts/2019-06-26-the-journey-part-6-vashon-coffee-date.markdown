Location: Vashon, WA

We boarded a ferry in search of Morgan's puffin "Sqwinky". On accident, our supplies were left on the mainlaind.

The island that we are visiting are friendly and smell of patchouli. However, the only provision on the island is coffee. Because of her addiction, Jennifer has quit brewing to drink it and is now eating the beans right out of the roaster.

We have decided to harness this abundance of energy by building a paddle boat. Instead of steam, we have a large hamster wheel for Jenn to run on. 

We expect to reach speeds of 50 knots.
