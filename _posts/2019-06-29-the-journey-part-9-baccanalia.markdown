Location: Toledo, WA

Maybe mountains don't exist.

When we exited the fog around the supposed Olympic mountains, we ended up in a large crater that was supposed to be named after some lady named Helen. I wonder if that is the same on that was in Troy?

Along the way, we picked up a rather tall and hairy hitchhiker who couldn't really talk well and just seemed to grunt. We have seen a lot of guys with long beards, but most of them wear some sort of plaid to make it clear enough that they are dressed Morgan named him "Bacca". We asked Bacca what he was up to and he seemed to gesture that he was on his way to visit some friends far away.

Along the way, we passed through Tacoma. Since the famous song says that Phoenix is supposed to be the start of the journey, and not the destination, we decided to not cross the dessert and have started heading back north.
