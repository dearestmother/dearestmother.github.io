The time incident that we had over a year ago with the time space continium caused by springing too far forward. At least, that is what I think happened. Jenn said that there wasn't anything sci-fi going on, it was just that I finally woke up from a coma due to Morgan smacking my noggin with a 2x4 because she was upset about the prank.

Summer is upon us with the temperature rising, cicadas voices rising, and the cost of lumber rising. We have started a business selling 2x4 lumber for construction. Unlike our breadstick boat, the wood in our materials actually grows on trees. After we felled every tree on the property and made a fantastic bit of scratch, we quickly realized that we were completely out of stock.

To rectify that, we replanted hundreds of trees. Normally, this would require decades to regrow to be worth it to re-ungrow. Lain said that he saw something called "Miracle Grow" back at the nursery that we got the replacement saplings. After sprinkling the powder on any tree, we wait a few minute and... nothing happened. Questioning what we were doing wrong, we started to pick dieties that might have something to do with harvests and prayed to them for the Miracle powder to actually "Miracle". 

Cereal did nothing. Deinch (because we use imperial measurement) could't be bothered. Havarti sounded cheesed off and said that we had the wrong address. Lastly, we actually contacted Osiris but he said it was the wrong time of the cycle and Neper was out of town fishing.

I guess you can't put much trust into magic and quick fixes and instead have to just trust the science and wait.
