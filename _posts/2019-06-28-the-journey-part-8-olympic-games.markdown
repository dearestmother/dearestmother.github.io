Location: Port Angeles, WA

We arrived either too soon (or too late) for the Olympics. Either that, or it was too foggy to see them from the top of Hurricane Ridge. 

In lieu of this, we held our own impromptu ceremony when Lain announced to Morgan that not only does Squinky hold a place in her heart, he also held a place in her stomach for a little while.

Morgan won the gold medal in the 100 year das and Judo. Lain earned one for his fantastic luge performance after she threw him off the mountain.
