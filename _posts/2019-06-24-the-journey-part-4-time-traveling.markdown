Location: Victoria, BC

I feel that we are lost.

A shaman gave us to achive victory, but we ended up in Victoria. Worse than that, we time travelled from AD to BC!

The residents here are very quirky and healthy. This may be due to some shared system of government that we are not accustom to. Perhaps this is a social manifest destiny?

Lain contracted dysentary, so we married him to a local girl to be able to access the program. We he realized that the Nintendo Switch wouldn't be invented until 2016 AD and we were in 2016 BC, he rushed to find us and continue on our journey.

We hope to find a way back to our own time, even though our government and healthcare are more primative.
