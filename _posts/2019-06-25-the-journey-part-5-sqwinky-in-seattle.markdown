Location: Seattle, WA

We caught our fill of salmon, so we headed to the market. Fish were being tossed about like rolls at Lambert's restaurant.

Morgan caugh a pet puffin and named it "Sqwinky" because it winks at you when it squats to eject yesterday's meal. It is particularly unfriendly towards Lain, who now wakes to an inch thick layer of film on his head each morning.

We are currently riding in a horseless wagon train in search of adventure. There isn't much that we have planned in stone for the next week.

Lain says he wants to celebrate our return by preparing us a fine chicken dinner.
