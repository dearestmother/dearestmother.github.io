Our food problems are solved.

After returning to the mainland, we ended up in a Garden of Olives. There wasn't much of a garden, nor olives. What they did have was a flawed policy on unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks.

Due to Lain's unnatural talent for kleptomancy, we were able to create a tow barge of breadsticks loaded with 50 tons of soup and salad.

There were signs pointing to a store that sells sequins, as well. Jennifer and Morgan, being both avid crafters, demanded that we head that way. When we arrived, there were numerous lush lavender fields, but no sequins in sight.

It was then that we noticed that the signs had M's, not N's.

How confusing is that?
