We have been living on the other end of the prairie for 5 years now.

The first thing we noticed is that things aren't as simple as that Companion Radio show led us to believe. Maybe, the prairie here isn't the same as the one bordering Lake Woebegon.

Last weekend was our yearly apple festival. It is normally a pleasent day of sipping cider in the park and meandering around the booths that are selling quilts and dream catchers while sipping cold apple cider.

Things got hectic when it turned out that the County Archery Tournament was also scheduled for the same day. As the archers arrived, the became transfixed on the red apples the same way that a bull will on a red cape. Their William Tell training took hold and arrows began to be launched in ernest towards every apple in sight. Teams of archers joined formations and launched volleys into the scattered crates around the park.

There were only a few injuries. Lain was holding an apple to his mouth when an arrow pieced through it and his hand, pinning it all together like a toothpick through a bacon wrapped hors d'oeuvres.

He is in good spirits and says that all the boys are getting piercings these days.
