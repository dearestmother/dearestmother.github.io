We have reached the planned most northern point of our adventure.

Fortunately, we were able to follow the paths of the pioneers in the luxury of a motorized mega-wagon train.

We ended up at the top of the mountains and found a large lake filled with emeralds. Lain wanted to take some home, but the emeralds that were making the lake so vividly green were too small.

He had the brilliant idea to drink some of the water and recover the diamonds later.

It most certainly worked as a few hours later on our way back south, he was turning just as green as the lake.
