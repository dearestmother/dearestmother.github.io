The moving picture season of big action is back upon us! It seems like it is going to be nonstop eyecandy of explosions until the new year starts.

Our theater was built 100 years ago and has seen everything from silent pictures with a piano being played using sheet music to concerts by bands from all musical genres to the newest cutting edge of digital projection. Sometimes it feels like patrons are still comming to the shows even after their deaths in the form of apparitions which is why we run some really old movies to keep them happy and entertained as well.

But this time of year is for all the latest hits. We finally started drawing a crowd of people. They gasped and awed at the hundreds of exploding helicopters. The last minute dives of the hero as he tries to use the hidden code in a Frank Lloyd Wright painting. The fantastic flying dragons breathing fire over medieval villages. What was really even more fantastic is that is was all the same movie!

After the last film for they day, as everyone was leaving and I closed the door myself to head home, we all found out that some of the apparitional vapors might not have been ghosts as the whole theater itself evaporated in a cinematic fireball. It turned out that a gas leak had just reached it's point of maximum concentration and took most of the buildings on the block with it.

After we rebuild, we might try to stick with musicals or maybe some comedies instead.
