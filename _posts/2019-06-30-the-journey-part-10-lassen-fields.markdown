Location: Vancouver, BC

We have crossed the border into Canada again. As such, we have decided to try out the local delicacies.

Ketchup flavored Doritos, Mint Chocolate Kit Kats, Kraft Dinner, and soda with real sugar. The Kraft Dinner reminded us most at home where we call it Mac and Cheese. I assume they eat so much Mac and Cheese as a default for the evening meal that it just became easier to call it "Dinner" the same way that we call facial tissue "Kleenex".

We have emptied out our wagon of all non-essentials and packed it to the gills with Dr Pepper. The 400 horses of power seem to stuggle from the load.

Our phones are also have fallen in love as no longer Sprinting and are now all Rogering. Is Canada the country of love?

Sadly, we bid farewell to Bacca as he gestured about needing to go over a bridge made of land to visit his girlfriend. I think he said her name was Ygrite or maybe Leti?
