Turning back the clocks this year got a little strange. Normally, I am asleep at 2 AM when we go back an hour. However, there was a show on that I wanted to finish. When I went to go set the clock back and watch another episode, the previous me was already on the couch watching the episode that just finished. Rather than watch it again, I got myself caught up on the key parts of the previous episode and watched the next one.

When it was over, we had a few minutes before previous me had to go and set the clocks back, so we decided to go and play a prank on the Morgans. Both the past and present Morgan were asleep in bed next to each other, so we took both of their phones and set the time back two hours. Now, current Morgan is previous Morgan and previous Morgan is even more previous Morgan. Around that time, future Morgan popped into existence in the bed as previous John and previous and present Morgan faded away.

I guess I am stuck with this one until we "Spring Forward" on March 8th.
